        <h1 id="title">The Lost Art of Marginalia</h1>
        <p>Marginalia are marks made in the margins of a book. Some typical examples of this are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Annotations made by someone studying a textbook,</li>
          <li>Comments written by a scholar to support the understanding of later readers, or</li>
          <li>Doodles or illustrations drawn just for the fun of it!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The American painter Charles E. Burchfield said:</p>
        <p class="quote">“Doodling serves as a means of keeping the hand or fingers limber, so that they are always ready for serious work.”</p>
        <p>If you ever scribbled in the margin of your exercise book at school, you have created a piece of marginalia art, and have taken part in a tradition that has likely been around for as long as we've had mediums to draw and write on.</p>
        <p>In medieval Europe manuscripts were crafted by scribes in monasteries and other professional artisans, and they would often embellish their work with all manner of bizarre illustrations, such as monsters and animals behaving like humans. Knights battling snails are a common theme.</p>
        <p>These marginalia supposedly have context and sometimes provide commentary on the text, or could even be the equivalent of pop-culture references, but it is usually difficult to decode their meaning as we don't always know the illustrator's intention, or all of the links and wordplay involved.  A difficult task for art historians!</p>
        <p>Some of the illustrations are quite shocking, especially as they are often adjacent to religious text. We tend to picture medieval Europe as being a time of strict boundaries, and so I find medieval marginalia to be an interesting suggestion that perhaps those boundaries weren't as entirely rigid as we might first think.</p>
        <p>Scroll down to see some of my favourite examples of medieval marginalia.</p>
